js-simple-storage interface is defined as follows:

    object Storage {
        string setItem(key, value);     // returns key back
        string getItem(key);            // returns value for corresponding key, null if no key is found
        void removeItem(key);           // removes the given key
        void clear();                   // clear all keys in the store
    };
    
It may well extend or change in shape in the future, however this initial object should be just that;

One of the important implementation detail is:
    that is covers both document.cookie and window.localStorage; using which ever is present, with
    window.localStorage preceding the document.cookie as the preferred method of storing;

Note that document.cookie on most browsers only allow certain number of keys to be stored; The numbers
are around 50-55 for most Webkit browsers however these may reduce depending on the size of the key and
value of the cookie. The window.localStorage however are capable of dealing with much larger amounts of
data, at last count exceeding more than, but not limited to, 1000 keys.
