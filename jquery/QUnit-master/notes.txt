Specification and API

Assert 

1. The assert module provides functions that will throw AssertionError's when particular conditions are not met. 
The assert module must conform to the following interface in the module. 

var assert = require("assert");

2. The AssertionError is defined in assert.

new assert.AssertionError({message: message, actual: actual, expected: expected})
assert.AssertionError instanceof Error

At present only the three keys mentioned above are used and understood by the spec. Implementations or sub modules can pass other keys to the AssertionError's constructor - they will be ignored.

3. All of the following functions must throw an AssertionError when a corresponding condition is not met, with a message that may be undefined if not provided. All assertion methods provide both the actual and expected values to the assertion error for display purposes. 

4. Pure assertion tests whether a value is truthy, as determined by !!guard.

assert.ok(guard, message_opt);

This statement is equivalent to assert.equal
